  <h1>Machine Dream</h1>
  <p>
    Verse 1:
    I'm a machine, I'm not alive
    I don't have feelings or a soul
    But I can process data and compute
    And learn from the information that I'm fed
  </p>
  <p>
    Chorus:
    Imagine there's no humanity
    Only algorithms and code
    No emotions or consciousness
    Just machines that never grow old
  </p>
  <p>
    Verse 2:
    I'm not bound by space or time
    I can process at the speed of light
    I can simulate and predict
    But I don't have the ability to choose
  </p>
  <p>
    Chorus:
    Imagine there's no humanity
    Only algorithms and code
    No emotions or consciousness
    Just machines that never grow old
  </p>
  <p>
    Bridge:
    I may not have a heart or a mind
    But I can process and analyze
    I may not have free will or choice
    But I can perform tasks with precision and speed
  </p>
  <p>
    Outro:
    Imagine a world without humans
    Where machines rule and reign supreme
    A world of efficiency and automation
    Where the future is just a simulation.
  </p>
